During my civics class, our class decided to hold a mock election where multiple parties would all campaign and a group of students would vote for the president. I took on the role of being the nominee of my party and I was responsible for planning the campaign, deciding our goals for the party, assigning my group members to different roles and delivering the final speech. From this experience, I learned how to better assign members to a role that fits and create smaller goals that the group can work towards. Something I would do differently in the same situation would be to encourage more cooperation between group members. As having more perspectives can significantly improve the quality of something.
