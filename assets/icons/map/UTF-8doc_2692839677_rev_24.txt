 I have been involved in the Dungeons and Dragons club for around 2 years, mainly as a dungeon master. As the dungeon master, I took up the responsibility of organizing campaigns, telling a good story and guiding my players through their adventures. My involvement fostered friendship, teamwork, and adaptability within my players as they worked together to achieve a common goal. I also helped create a more welcoming environment by acting as the dungeon master for newer players. Through this experience, I learned the importance of multiple perspectives and collaboration when it comes to problem-solving. Additionally, I significantly improved my leadership and creative writing skills as I prepared engaging adventures for my players to embark on.
